<!-- 
cellspacing="0" attribute is used in HTML to control the space between cells in
a <table>. Specifically, it sets the amount of space between the borders of adjacent
cells. The value 0 means there is no space between cells.
The cellspacing="0" attribute removes any space between the cells in the table. The cells will appear to be "joined" with no gaps in between them
