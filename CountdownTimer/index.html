<!-- onInput: This event handler is triggered every time the value of the input element changes (i.e., when the user types, pastes, or deletes characters).
this.value: Refers to the current value of the input element.
this.maxLength: Refers to the maxLength attribute of the input element, which specifies the maximum number of characters allowed in the input. -->

<!-- The onInput and onChange event handlers are both used to respond to changes in
an input field.

The onInput and onChange event handlers are both used to respond
to changes in an input field, but they are triggered at different times and
serve slightly different purposes. Here are the key differences: onInput When it
triggers: 

The onInput event fires immediately when the value of an input element
changes. This can happen with every keystroke, paste, or delete action.

onChange
When it triggers: The onChange event fires when the input element loses focus after its value has changed. In other words, it triggers after the user has finished their input and moved away from the input field (e.g., by clicking outside the field or pressing the Tab key). -->
